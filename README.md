Here you can find a quick implementation of the algolia research toolbar where you can browse in the different concert you have in your database.

For the display part, I've used the property below I have in my in my database :
- Name
- Location
- Date

The date parameter is originaly a timestamp. I've made a modification on it to be able to display it with more something visual for the end user.

I've delete the quick search on the left side of the page because in this case (concert) it was not something relevant.

And to finish, as you can see you can provide different keyword to make a research in your content.
